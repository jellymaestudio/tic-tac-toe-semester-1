# Tic-Tac-Toe (Semester 1)

This project is my first implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, created during the semester break after my **first semester of Applied Computer Science**.

The goal of this project was to practice:
- basic Java syntax
- control structures
- game logic
- clean and readable code at an early stage of my studies

This repository intentionally represents my **early skill level** and serves as a reference point to compare my progress with later versions of the same game.

## Future Plans

A second version of this project will be developed after later semesters to:
- improve code structure
- apply better design principles
- possibly add a GUI or additional features

This will allow a direct **side-by-side comparison** of my progress as a developer.

## Notes

This project is not meant to be a final or perfect solution.  
It documents my learning process and growth as a computer science student.
